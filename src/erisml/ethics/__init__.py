erisml.ethics
=============

Public API for the ErisML ethics / DEME subsystem.

This package implements **DEME** (Democratically Governed Ethics Modules) for
ErisML. It is designed around a strict boundary:

- Domain & assessment layers are responsible for:
  * interpreting raw data (EHR, sensors, logs, AIS, etc.),
  * computing clinically / technically relevant quantities,
  * mapping those into EthicalFacts for each candidate option.

- Ethics modules (EMs) are responsible for:
  * consuming EthicalFacts only (no direct access to raw domain data),
  * performing purely normative reasoning,
  * emitting EthicalJudgement objects that can be aggregated via governance.

The main concepts are:

Facts & ethical dimensions
--------------------------

- ``EthicalFacts``:
    Domain-agnostic, structured envelope of ethically relevant facts for
    a single candidate option.

- Ethical dimension dataclasses (sub-structures of EthicalFacts):
    * ``Consequences``                – benefit, harm, urgency, affected_count
    * ``RightsAndDuties``             – rights, consent, explicit rules, duties
    * ``JusticeAndFairness``          – discrimination, disadvantage, power
    * ``AutonomyAndAgency``           – meaningful choice, coercion, dark patterns
    * ``PrivacyAndDataGovernance``    – privacy, data minimization, secondary use
    * ``SocietalAndEnvironmental``    – environment, long-term risk, burden
    * ``VirtueAndCare``               – compassion, trust, respect for persons
    * ``ProceduralAndLegitimacy``     – procedures, consultation, contestation
    * ``EpistemicStatus``             – uncertainty, evidence quality, novelty

Judgements & module interfaces
------------------------------

- ``Verdict``:
    Literal verdict type: one of
    ``"strongly_prefer" | "prefer" | "neutral" | "avoid" | "forbid"``.

- ``EthicalJudgement``:
    Normative assessment of a candidate option by a single EM (or governance).

- ``EthicsModule``:
    Protocol interface implemented by concrete EMs.

- ``BaseEthicsModule``:
    Convenience base class providing common functionality for EMs.

Democratic governance
---------------------

- ``GovernanceConfig``:
    Configuration for aggregating EM judgements:
    stakeholder weights, EM weights, veto EMs, thresholds, tie-breaking.

- ``DecisionOutcome``:
    Governance-level decision for a set of candidate options:
    selected option, ranked options, forbidden options, aggregated judgements.

- ``aggregate_judgements(option_id, judgements, cfg)``:
    Aggregate all EthicalJudgement objects for a single option into a
    governance-level EthicalJudgement.

- ``select_option(judgements_by_option, cfg, candidate_ids, baseline_option_id)``:
    Aggregate across options, filter forbidden / low-score options, and select
    a winner according to GovernanceConfig.

Domain & assessment interfaces
------------------------------

- ``CandidateOption``:
    Small wrapper for domain-level candidate options (id + payload).

- ``DomainAssessmentContext``:
    Opaque container for domain state/config used by assessment logic.

- ``EthicalFactsBuilder`` / ``BatchEthicalFactsBuilder``:
    Protocols for components that construct EthicalFacts from domain data.

- ``build_facts_for_options(builder, options, context)``:
    Helper to build EthicalFacts for many options with a simple builder.

Interop helpers
---------------

- ``get_ethical_facts_schema()``:
    JSON Schema (draft-07) describing the EthicalFacts structure.

- ``get_ethical_judgement_schema()``:
    JSON Schema (draft-07) describing the EthicalJudgement structure.

Serialization helpers for these types live under
``erisml.ethics.interop.serialization`` and are not re-exported here
to keep the top-level API concise.
